# Trees
A tree data structure is a non-linear data structure because it does not store in a sequential manner. It is a hierarchical structure as elements in a Tree are arranged in multiple levels. In the Tree data structure, the topmost node is known as a root node. Each node contains some data, and data can be of any type.

## Challenge 

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
- Create a BinaryTree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
- Create a BinarySearchTree class
  - Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
  - Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## API
<br>

 - `Add ` method accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
  
- `contains` method accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
