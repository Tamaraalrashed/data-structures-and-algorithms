# Challenge Summary

Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a k-ary tree as an argument.<br>

Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:

- If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”.

- If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”.

- If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”

- If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply return the number into a String.

## Approach & Efficiency

Using a tree data structure I will determine if the value is divisible by 3, 5 or both.<br>
Big O for time is O(n) and for space as well.
